# Book Scraping Project 1 

**Version 1.2**


# Project Configuration

## Pull the project from github 
	
- After getting access to the github repository, pull the project with the following command :
	```python 	
	git clone https://github.com/MiladEzame/Books_Scrapping.git
	```
## Creating a virtual environment

- Python installation is required for the following process. You can download Python on python.org.
Python3 includes venv that allows us to create a virtual environment very easily.
Write the following command line in your windows command prompt to create a new virtual environment 
called __environment_name__ :
	```python 	
	python3 -m venv environment_name
	```
	
- Once you've created the virtual environment, you have to activate it.
	On __Windows__, type the following command :
	```python	
	environment_name\Scripts\activate.bat
	```
	On __Unix__ or __MacOS__, type the following command:
	```python 		
	source environment_name/bin/activate
	```
	If you have any difficulties, please refer to this page : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

## Install requirement files

- Once the environment is __active__, type this in the command prompt : 
	```python 	
	pip install -r requirements.txt	
	```
## Lauch the script 
	
- There are 3 scripts, each script is explained in the next section. 
First, open the git bash inside the project folder if you are not in it.
Before running the script, make sure you are in the virtual environment.
You can run the scrap_all_categories.py file by using the following command :
	```python 	
	python scrap_all_categories.py	
	```
